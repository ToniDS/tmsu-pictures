# tmsu-pictures
Using tmsu to tag my pictures up

This repository helps me tag my pictures up. 
change_date.sh and change_timezones.py are helpers to change the time of the exif data, because I forgot to change my camera's time settings.

tag_from exifread.py and tag_from_exif.sh create the date tags from exif tags.


##TODO: Integration with Darktable: I would like to be able to import the tags with darktable, add some tags to darktable, 
edit some pictures, and then read it back to tmsu.

##TODO: Possible graphical interface for tagging individual files
